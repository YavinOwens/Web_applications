## Introduction
This document outlines the workflow for gathering requirements using OpenAI, Assembly AI, and LangChain. The process involves leveraging AI to gather, analyze, and structure requirements efficiently.

## Tools and Technologies
- **OpenAI**: For generating questions and gathering insights.
- **Assembly AI**: For transcribing and analyzing audio inputs.
- **LangChain**: For chaining prompts and managing the interaction flow.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **Define Objectives**: Establish the goals of the requirements gathering session.
- **Identify Stakeholders**: List the key stakeholders and participants.

### Step 2: Gathering Requirements
- **Audio Input**: Record conversations with stakeholders using Assembly AI for transcription.
  ```python
  import assemblyai as aai

  transcriber = aai.Transcriber(api_key='your_api_key')
  transcript = transcriber.transcribe('path/to/audio/file')
   ```
  ### Step 3: Prompt Generation and Chaining
- **Generate Questions**: Use OpenAI to create a list of questions based on the initial objectives.
  ```python
  import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-003",
       prompt="Generate a list of questions for gathering software requirements...",
       max_tokens=150
   )
   questions = response.choices[0].text.strip().split('\n')
   ```
-  **Prompt Chaining**: Use LangChain to manage the flow of questions and follow-up prompts.
  
   ```python
  from langchain import PromptChain
   chain = PromptChain(api_key='your_api_key')
   chain.add_prompts(questions)
   chain.run()
   ```
   ### Step 4: Analyzing and Structuring Data

-  **Analyze Responses**: Use AI models to analyze the transcribed responses and extract key information.

   ```python
  analyzed_data = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=f"Analyze the following transcript and extract key requirements:\n{transcript['text']}",
    max_tokens=500
)
   ```
