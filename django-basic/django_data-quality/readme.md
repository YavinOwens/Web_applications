# Data Quality and Governance App

This Django application allows users to upload CSV and Excel files for data quality and governance analysis. Each sheet in an uploaded Excel file is read in as a CSV and saved in memory or as a file. The app provides key information for data quality and data governance best practices.

## Features

- Upload CSV files for analysis
- Upload Excel files and process each sheet as a CSV
- Analyze datasets for data quality and governance
- Generate descriptive statistics and key metrics

## User Interaction and App Process

| Step | Description                                                                                  |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **User uploads a CSV or Excel file**: The user initiates the process by uploading a file.    |
| 2    | **File is processed**: The application reads and processes the uploaded file.                |
| 3    | **Data quality analysis is performed**: The app analyzes the data for quality and governance.|
| 4    | **Reports are generated**: The application generates reports based on the analysis.          |
| 5    | **User views results**: The user can view the results and reports generated by the app.      |

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the user interaction and the app process. The user uploads a file, which is processed by the app to perform data quality analysis and generate reports, which the user can then view.
